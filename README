The .ml files in this folder contain the code for the home assignment for the MPRI 2-4 course.

They have been tested using OCaml 4.02.1, on a computer running 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with
12GB RAM. I believe they should work on earlier versions but this may require defining the
operator (|>) manually.

Please note that the code written here was NOT written with performance in mind. As such, many
functions are not tail-recursive, and I've used List.map throughout the code, instead of List.rev_map.
This means that in certain cases, running a monadic computation may produce a stack overflow, although
this isn't the case for the current code in my computer.

I've implemented all the exercises mentioned in the project description, and all the tests seem to work
just as expected. I'm generally very confident in the quality of the code, other than its performance,
except for the code corresponding to memoized fixpoint combinators described in Task 6.3, which I don't
trust a lot, although it works fine and makes sense.

During the exercise, I found myself re-implementing a filter_map function, like the one found in
Jane Street's Core, Batteries and Extlib. I think such a function would be very useful as part of
the standard library.
